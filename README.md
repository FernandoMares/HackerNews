# HackerNewsTopStories
.NET Core app for fetching and ranking top Hacker News stories by score. Includes HackerNewsService for API interaction and xUnit/Moq tests for validation. Provides endpoints to retrieve and query top stories. Clone, build, and test functionality with provided instructions.

## Features

### Retrieve Top Stories:
  - Fetch the top `n` stories from Hacker News.
### Sorted by Score:
  - Stories are returned in descending order of score.
### Detailed Story Information:
  -  Includes title, URL, author, timestamp, score, and comment count.
### Efficient Data Retrieval
  - Minimizes the load on the Hacker News API by efficiently handling requests.

## Getting Started
Prerequisites
.NET 6.0 SDK

#### Running the Application
Clone the repository:

 - git clone https://github.com/FernandoMares/HackerNews.git

 - Open Visual Studio and select Open a project or solution.

 - Navigate to the HackerNews/DeveloperCodingTestFGM folder and open the solution file (.sln).
 
 - Build and run the application by pressing F5 or selecting Debug > Start Debugging from the menu.

 - The API should be available at http://localhost:7209/swagger/index.html or http://localhost:5092/swagger/index.html (Port can be different)

## Project Structure

#### Common/GlobalConstants.cs
Contains constant values used throughout the application, such as endpoint URLs.

#### Controllers/StoriesController.cs
The controller responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests related to Hacker News stories. This is where the RESTful endpoints for interacting with the service are defined.

#### DTOs/StoryDto.cs
Defines the Data Transfer Object (DTO) for a story. The DTO is used to encapsulate the data sent between the client and the server, ensuring that only the required information is exposed.

#### Models/Story.cs
This file contains the model for a story. It mirrors the data structure used by the Hacker News API, representing the fields of a story, such as the title, score, author, and URL.

#### Services/HackerNewsService.cs
This is the core service class responsible for communicating with the Hacker News API. It fetches story data, processes the response, and provides the requested number of stories.

#### Program.cs
The entry point of the application. This file configures and runs the ASP.NET Core application, setting up services.

#### Tests/
This folder contains the test suite for the application, ensuring the code works as expected.

#### Services/HackerNewsServiceTests.cs
Contains the unit tests for the HackerNewsService. These tests validate the service logic by mocking external API calls and checking for expected results under different scenarios.
